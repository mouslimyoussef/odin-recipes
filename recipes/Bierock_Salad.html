    <h1>Bierock Salad made easy</h1>
    <p>This bierock salad is a Germany-meets-Midwest salad bowl tribute to the hyper-regional handheld sandwich. Ground

        <li>1 (14.4 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded cabbage</li>
        <li>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to make</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet, breaking it up
            into small pieces, 1 to 2 minutes. Add onions and Worcestershire sauce. Cook and stir until beef is browned
            and onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.

        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Set frozen yeast rolls on a baking sheet.

        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 7 to 9 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely,
            about 20 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.

        </li>
        <li>Cut cooled rolls into crouton-sized pieces. Melt butter in the microwave for 30 seconds. Place bread pieces
            into a bowl and pour melted butter evenly over the top. Sprinkle buttered roll pieces with 1 tablespoon
            Everything seasoning. Shake bowl to distribute seasoning and butter evenly. Spread bread pieces on the
            prepared baking sheet.

        </li>
        <li>Bake croutons in the preheated oven until croutons are dry and crunchy, about 5 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>To assemble salad, place drained sauerkraut in the bottom of a large bowl. Add cabbage, vinegar, sugar,
            mustard, remaining 1 tablespoon Everything seasoning, and shredded Cheddar. Mix in cooled hamburger mixture
            until well combined.

        </li>
        <li>Serve in individual bowls and top with croutons.
